That leaves no other way but to consider a picture “ready” at some point. Digital painting and editing seriously undermines such attitude - it is a medium that does not bare any speci­fic content itself, yet important for its effect: digital editing allows you to keep working on image not necessarily exterminating it’s previous phases. Computer processing changes perception of “readiness” of image we are working at - it allows us to make as many copies of images, considered “ready” at various steps of editing, as we want. That in fact brings us from singe “readiness” to plural. It also empowers us to ponder image as something that deviates from a “ready” object of consumption to a time process (evolution), and painting as a genre deviates from space-based art to time-based art domain, traditionally reserved for music and performance arts. Technological “InfiniteLoop” is, hypothetically, a phase that comes next after AI is invented and implemented, and self-replicating machines take the further development in their hands at the speed that human aren’t able to follow. In the “InfiniteLoop” series, Litto’s reverses this external, “artificial” potential line of development back to “internal” intellection to reconsider to automations we carry as human entities. In so doing, a dynamical system, that is oil / canvas painting, becomes no longer confined by restrains of analog “readiness”, doing what all biological systems are doing given suitable environments - replicates. </p><p class="ellipsis">…</p></div><div class="link"><p><a href="https://artivive.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cooperation: Artivive</a></p></div><div class="link"><p><a href="http://soundframe.at/2018/12/16/translation-complexity-artivive/#info" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Exhibition: Translation of Complexity</a></p></div><div class="link"><p><a href="https://soundframe.at/2018/12/16/translation-complexity-artivive/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Exhibition: Sound:Frame @Artivive</a></p></div></div></div><div class="about-page"><div class="about-page-content"><iframe src="https://mslitto.github.io/weird"></iframe><div><p> Litto/aka Daniela Weiss is a multimedia artist originally from Vienna, Austria. Having a background in business communication and visual arts she alternates between both worlds giving her a diverse neural network of knowledge and greater understanding of various process’ perspectives. </p><p> After graduating from business school, she started studying communication design and subsequently moved to Amsterdam and Berlin where she freelanced as an UX- and web-designer, working on a wide range of interactive applications, content management systems, as well as installation concepts. Litto works exclusively with “augmented reality paintings” as a means to emphasise the importance of traditional analogue techniques, re-actualised and re-purposed by digital media tools. </p><p> Most recently, Litto has been exploring the involvement of technology and interactivity in art. This has driven her to take off a diploma degree in digital art at the university of applied arts in vienna. Her current focus is on AR and VR installations. </p></div></div></div><div class="footer main"><a class="about-page-trigger" href="https://www.instagram.com/ms.litto" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="/litto.work/img/logo.png"></a></div><script src="/litto.work/js/index.js"></script></body></html>
