Having a background in business communication and visual arts she alternates between both worlds giving her a diverse neural network of knowledge and greater understanding of various process’ perspectives. </p><p> After graduating from business school, she started studying communication design and subsequently moved to Amsterdam and Berlin where she freelanced as an UX- and web-designer, working on a wide range of interactive applications, content management systems, as well as installation concepts. Litto works exclusively with “augmented reality paintings” as a means to emphasise the importance of traditional analogue techniques, re-actualised and re-purposed by digital media tools. </p><p> Most recently, Litto has been exploring the involvement of technology and interactivity in art. This has driven her to take off a diploma degree in digital art at the university of applied arts in vienna. Her current focus is on AR and VR installations. </p></div></div></div><div class="footer main"><a class="about-page-trigger" href="https://www.instagram.com/ms.litto" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="/litto.work/img/logo.png"></a></div><script src="/litto.work/js/index.js"></script></body></html>
