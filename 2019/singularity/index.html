That leaves no other way but to consider a picture “ready” at some point. Digital painting and editing seriously undermines such attitude - it is a medium that does not bare any speci­fic content itself, yet important for its effect: digital editing allows you to keep working on image not necessarily exterminating it’s previous phases. Computer processing changes perception of “readiness” of image we are working at - it allows us to make as many copies of images, considered “ready” at various steps of editing, as we want. That in fact brings us from singe “readiness” to plural. It also empowers us to ponder image as something that deviates from a “ready” object of consumption to a time process (evolution), and painting as a genre deviates from space-based art to time-based art domain, traditionally reserved for music and performance arts. Technological “InviniteLoop” is, hypothetically, a phase that comes next after AI is invented and implemented, and self-replicating machines take the further development in their hands at the speed that human aren’t able to follow. In the “InviniteLoop” series, Litto’s reverses this external, “artificial” potential line of development back to “internal” intellection to reconsider to automations we carry as human entities. In so doing, a dynamical system, that is oil / canvas painting, becomes no longer confined by restrains of analog “readiness”, doing what all biological systems are doing given suitable environments - replicates. </p><p class="ellipsis">…</p></div><div class="link"><p><a href="https://artivive.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cooperation: Artivive</a><a href="http://soundframe.at/2018/12/16/translation-complexity-artivive/#info" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Exhibition: Translation of Complexity</a></p></div><div class="link"><p><a href="https://soundframe.at/2018/12/16/translation-complexity-artivive/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Exhibition: Sound:Frame @Artivive</a></p></div></div></div><script src="/js/index.js"></script></body></html>
