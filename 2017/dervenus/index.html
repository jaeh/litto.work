As a man, you have to be robust, hard and endure everything unpleasant. Inside, you are sensitive and vulnerable and love pleasant things, but everybody wants to see the hard side of you.

The role models for both genders seem to be slowly merging and creating a kind of symbiosis. </p><p class="ellipsis">…</p></div><div class="link"><p><a href="https://artivive.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> Cooperation: Artivive </a></p><p><a href="http://magazin.vangardist.com/issue-68-new-man-edition/litto/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> Features @ Vangardist #8/2017 </a></p></div></div></div><div class="about-page"><div class="about-page-content"><iframe src="https://mslitto.github.io/weird"></iframe><div><p> Litto/aka Daniela Weiss is a multimedia artist originally from Vienna, Austria. Having a background in business communication and visual arts she alternates between both worlds giving her a diverse neural network of knowledge and greater understanding of various process’ perspectives. </p><p> After graduating from business school, she started studying communication design and subsequently moved to Amsterdam and Berlin where she freelanced as an UX- and web-designer, working on a wide range of interactive applications, content management systems, as well as installation concepts. Litto works exclusively with “augmented reality paintings” as a means to emphasise the importance of traditional analogue techniques, re-actualised and re-purposed by digital media tools. </p><p> Most recently, Litto has been exploring the involvement of technology and interactivity in art. This has driven her to take off a diploma degree in digital art at the university of applied arts in vienna. Her current focus is on AR and VR installations. </p></div></div></div><div class="footer main"><a class="about-page-trigger" href="https://www.instagram.com/ms.litto" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="/litto.work/img/logo.png"></a></div><script src="/litto.work/js/index.js"></script></body></html>
