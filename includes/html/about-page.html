        Litto/aka Daniela Weiss is a multimedia artist 
        originally from Vienna,
        Austria. Having a background in business
        communication and visual arts she
        alternates between both worlds giving her
        a diverse neural network of knowledge
        and greater understanding of various
        process’ perspectives.
    </p>

    <p>
        After graduating from business school,
        she started studying communication
        design and subsequently moved to
        Amsterdam and Berlin where she
        freelanced as an UX- and web-designer,
        working on a wide range of interactive
        applications, content management
        systems, as well as installation concepts.
        Litto works exclusively with “augmented
        reality paintings” as a means to emphasise
        the importance of traditional analogue
        techniques, re-actualised and re-purposed
        by digital media tools.

        Most recently, Litto has been exploring
        the involvement of technology and
        interactivity in art. This has driven her to
        take off a diploma degree in digital
        art at the university of applied arts in
        vienna. Her current focus is on AR and VR
        installations.
